# Compact Convertible

<iframe width="560" height="315" src=" https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfqGnbM_LIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is a very compact technic model with many features. The design is
inspired by everyday compact class cars with front wheel drive and
independent suspension. The model is compact, elegant, sturdy and very
playable. The front wheels are driven by two L-motors and a servo motor
takes care of the return-to-center steering.

But this is no ordinary compact, it's a fully functional convertible! When
it starts to rain, simply close the roof which forms a rigid structure over
the car. The roof folds up completely in the rear section of the car, and is
operated by two small linear actuators.

Still too much rain? Engage the 2-speed windshield wipers! The windshield
wipers are driven by an M-motor via a 2-speed "sliding worm wheel" gearbox.
The speed of the wiper motion is determined by the rotation direction of the
motor.

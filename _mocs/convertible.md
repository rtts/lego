# Compact Convertible

This is no ordinary compact, it's a fully functional convertible! When
it starts to rain, simply close the roof which forms a rigid structure
over the car. [The roof folds up completely in the rear section of the
car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfqGnbM_LIQ), and is operated by
two small linear actuators.

Still too much rain? Engage the 2-speed windshield wipers! The windshield
wipers are driven by an M-motor via a 2-speed "sliding worm wheel" gearbox.
The speed of the wiper motion is determined by the rotation direction of the
motor.

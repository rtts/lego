# Moon Buggy

Explore the moon with this extremely fast and highly maneuverable moon
buggy! Equipped with 4-wheel steering, full independent suspension,
and a really tight turning circle.

The [8830](https://brickset.com/sets/8830-1/) was my favorite
childhood Technic model and has been a big inspiration for this set!

# Pickup Truck

This pickup truck was one of my first Lego Technic creations, and the
first one that I created complete [building instructions](?pdf) for.
The drivetrain and steering are remotely controlled using *Power
Functions*. It uses an XL motor for drive and a Servo motor for
steering. It also features fully independent suspension with an
interesting linkage to reduce height. This linkage is the inspiration
for the ultra-compact suspension of the [Moon Buggy](/moonbuggy/).

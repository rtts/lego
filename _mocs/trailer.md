# Car with Trailer

No (European) driver's license? Then you wouldn't know what to do with
this model `:-)`

The remote control has three pedals and a steering wheel. The left
pedal operates the clutch, the middle pedal operates the disk brakes,
and the right pedal revs the engine. You have to figure out the rest!

You can also use this car to practice for your C license: drive it in
reverse and see if you can successfully back up the trailer into a
tight spot!

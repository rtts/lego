# Car with Trailer

No (European) driver's license? Then you wouldn't know what to do with
this model `:-)`

The remote control has three pedals and a steering wheel. The left
pedal operates the clutch: press it forward and the clutch disengages.
While holding the left pedal you can rev the fake V8 engine without
moving the car. Only when you release the clutch pedal the car will
move.

The middle pedal operates the disk brake system, bringing the car to a
halt immediately. Admittedly, this will happen anyway as soon as you
release the gas pedal because the single Power Functions L motor is
not really strong enough to reach high speeds `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

You can also use this car to practice for your C license: drive it in
reverse and see if you can successfully back up the trailer into a
tight spot!

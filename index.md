Hi there! I'm an MOC designer from the Netherlands and you've stumbled
upon my personal LEGO homepage. Here you'll find building instructions
(PDF), [LDraw](https://ldraw.org/) source files (MPD), and awesome
images of all my models. Everything can be downloaded and shared
freely under the terms of the
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.
Enjoy!

Greetings,
